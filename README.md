# Todos App Deployment on KinD

**This guide outlines a comprehensive approach to deploying a Kubernetes-based todos application on a KinD (Kubernetes in Docker) cluster. The process encompasses several critical steps, including creating Docker images that encapsulate the application's environment and dependencies, configuring essential Kubernetes resources such as Deployments and Services, and establishing network access via Ingress for external exposure. By following this guide, you will gain hands-on experience with containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, and networking in a local development setup. The objective is to provide a clear and systematic pathway for developers to effectively manage their applications in a microservices architecture, ensuring scalability and ease of deployment while leveraging the powerful features offered by Kubernetes and Docker. Whether you're a beginner seeking to understand the fundamentals or an experienced developer looking to streamline your workflow, this guide aims to equip you with the necessary tools and knowledge to successfully implement your todos application in a KinD environment**.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed before proceeding:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)

----

##  1: Set Up KinD Cluster

1. **Install KinD**: Follow the installation instructions in the [KinD documentation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation).
2. **Create a KinD Cluster**: Use the following command to create a KinD cluster with a specific name (e.g., `todos-cluster`).
   ```bash
   kind create cluster --name todos-cluster
   

----   

## 2: Docker

1. **Dockerfile**: Create a Dockerfile for your todos application. Define the environment and dependencies required to run your app.

2. **Build Docker Image**: Build an image from the Dockerfile using:
   ```bash
   docker build -t <your-dockerhub-username>/todos-app:latest .
   
3. Push Docker Image: Push this image to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
    ```bash
    docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/todos-app:latest.
4. Run Docker Container: Run a container using the newly built image to verify functionality.
     ```bash
     docker run -p 3000:3000 <your-dock
     erhub-username>/todos-app:latest.
5. Verify Container: Ensure the application is accessible from the container.

###  deployments
  
  1. Create Deployment YAML: Write a deployment.yaml file that specifies replicas, selectors, and the container image for your app.
  
  2. Apply the Deployment to the KinD cluster.
  
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f <deployment_name>.yaml
  
  3. Verify Deployment and Pods: Confirm the deployment and pods are running.
     ```bash
     kubectl get deployments
     kubectl get pods
     
    
###  service  

  1. Create Service YAML: Write a service.yaml to expose the Deployment internally within the cluster.
  
  
  2. Apply the Service to the KinD cluster.
  
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f <service_name>.yaml  
  
  3. Verify Service: List services to ensure connectivity within the cluster.
  
     ```bash
     kubectl get services

###ingress  

  1. install NGINX Ingress Controller: Set up NGINX Ingress to manage external access to services in KinD.

     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/kind/deploy.yaml

  2. Create and Apply Ingress YAML: Write an ingress.yaml file to configure access to the Service and apply it.

     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f <ingress_name>.yaml

  3. Access Application Externally: Add an entry in /etc/hosts pointing todos.local to your KinD nodeâ€™s IP (use kubectl get nodes -o wide to find the IP).



### ConfigMap and Secret

  -  Create ConfigMap YAML: Add configmap.yaml with necessary configuration data for your application.

  -  Create Secret YAML: Add secret.yaml with sensitive information (e.g., database credentials).
  
  - Apply ConfigMap and Secret to the cluster.
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f <configmap_name>.yaml
    kubectl apply -f <secret_name>.yaml
  
  - **Reference ConfigMap and Secret in Pod Configuration**: Update deployment.yaml to use these values.
  

###  PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim

  - Create PersistentVolume YAML: Define storage capacity and access in pv.yaml.
  
  - Create PersistentVolumeClaim YAML: Request the required storage in pvc.yaml.
  
  - Apply PV and PVC to the cluster. 
  
  - Mount PVC in Deployment Configuration: Update deployment.yaml to mount the PersistentVolumeClaim for data persistence.
  
  
  
###  Final Steps

  - Access the App: Visit the application via the configured Ingress endpoint (e.g., http://todos.local) to confirm setup completion.
